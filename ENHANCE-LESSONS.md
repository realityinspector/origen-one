# Enhanced Lesson System

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the educational content system with richer, more engaging lessons.

## Overview

The enhanced lesson system uses AI to generate structured, rich educational content with images, diagrams, and properly segmented content to improve the learning experience.

### Technology Stack
- **Content Generation**: OpenRouter API (Claude 3 Opus model)
- **Image Generation**: Stability AI API
- **Content Display**: React Native with Markdown support
- **Data Format**: Enhanced JSON structure with support for rich media

## Key Features

1. **Structured Content Format**
   - Organized sections with clear headings
   - Rich Markdown formatting
   - Support for embedded images and diagrams
   - Learning metadata (duration, difficulty, grade level)

2. **AI-Generated Educational Images**
   - Relevant illustrations for key concepts
   - Diagrams for complex topics (flowcharts, concept maps, etc.)
   - Age-appropriate visual content

3. **Enhanced Assessment**
   - Questions linked to specific content sections
   - Explanations for correct/incorrect answers
   - Varied question types

4. **Metadata & Context**
   - Related topics for further exploration
   - Keywords and vocabulary
   - Estimated completion time

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Lesson Structure

```typescript
interface EnhancedLessonSpec {
  title: string;
  targetGradeLevel: number;
  subtitle?: string;
  summary: string;
  sections: {
    title: string;
    content: string;
    type: string;
    imageIds?: string[];
  }[];
  featuredImage?: string;
  images: {
    id: string;
    description: string;
    alt: string;
    base64Data?: string;
    svgData?: string;
    promptUsed: string;
  }[];
  diagrams: {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    title: string;
    svgData: string;
    description: string;
  }[];
  questions: any[];
  graph?: any;
  keywords: string[];
  relatedTopics: string[];
  estimatedDuration: number;
  difficultyLevel: string;
}
```

### Server-Side Components

1. **stability-service.ts**
   - Integration with Stability AI for image generation
   - Educational image generation with appropriate prompts
   - Diagram generation for educational concepts

2. **enhanced-lesson-service.ts**
   - Integration with OpenRouter for content generation
   - Structured lesson format creation
   - Image placement and integration
   - Question generation

3. **ai.ts (updates)**
   - Support for both legacy and enhanced lesson formats
   - Feature detection for gradual rollout

### Client-Side Components

1. **EnhancedLessonContent.tsx**
   - Rich rendering of enhanced lesson content
   - Support for displaying images and diagrams
   - Section-based navigation
   - Metadata display

2. **lesson-page.tsx (updates)**
   - Backwards compatibility with legacy lessons
   - Support for new enhanced lesson format

## Performance Considerations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Appropriate size for mobile devices
   - Progressive loading for slower connections
   - Fallback to text-only when needed

2. **Content Loading**
   - Chunked loading for large lessons
   - Caching strategies for offline access
   - Progress indicators for generation steps

## Rollout Plan

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure**
   - Set up Stability AI integration
   - Implement enhanced lesson format on server
   - Create client components for rendering

2. **Phase 2: Testing**
   - Generate test lessons across grade levels
   - Validate image generation quality and appropriateness
   - Performance testing on target devices

3. **Phase 3: Rollout**
   - Enable enhanced lessons for new content
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Collect usage metrics and feedback

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement**
   - Time spent with enhanced vs. standard lessons
   - Completion rates for lessons

2. **Learning Outcomes**
   - Quiz performance comparison
   - Knowledge retention tests

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Subjective ratings from students and teachers
   - Feature usage tracking

## Future Enhancements

- Interactive elements (drag-and-drop, simple simulations)
- Audio narration of content
- Personalized image generation based on user preferences
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user performance
