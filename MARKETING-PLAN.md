Alright—CEO hat on. Here’s a tight, founder-ready marketing platform + GTM plan that positions **SUNSCHOOL by AOT Labs** as the open, parent-powered AI tutor that lives *inside* All One Thing (AOT) spaces and community programming.

# Positioning (one line)

**SUNSCHOOL** — the AI tutor where **Parents Own the Prompt**. Open-source, transparent, community-driven learning—**built into every AOT space** and lifestyle loop (city ↔ country, co-work ↔ co-learn). 

---

## Who we’re for (ICP tiers)

1. **Safety- & sovereignty-minded parents** (homeschoolers, microschoolers, after-schoolers) who want control, visibility, and portability of their child’s learning.
2. **AOT Community Founders & Hosts** who need a reliable, family-friendly “learning engine” that works on-site and at pop-ups, connected to AOT’s 24/7 programming. 
3. **SBNR / “Emergent” Families** seeking meaning, community, and nature-tech harmony, not institution-owned black boxes. 

---

## Value pillars (message map)

* **Parent Owns the Prompt** → Transparent, auditable, remixable learning flows. No black-box decisions.
* **Open Source Core** → Inspect, fork, improve; community extensions live alongside official features.
* **Portable & Offline-friendly** → Satellite-ready; “school anywhere under the sun.”
* **AOT-Integrated** → Live coaches + AI in staffed learning spaces; parents cowork next door; community rituals/events tie learning to life.  
* **Whole-family lifestyle** → Intergenerational activities, solstice rituals, Wilderness Wednesdays, Kids AI Storybook workshops—learning flows into community.

## Competitive frame: Open vs. Closed (site copy ready)

**Why transparency matters for your child’s education**

❌ **Closed AI systems**
– Platform controls/rewrites prompts
– Your data is locked & monetized
– Invisible decision chains
– Add-on upsells and paywalls
– Minimal customization

✅ **SUNSCHOOL (Open + Parent-Owned)**
– Parents own & version prompts
– Data can sync to *your* private store
– Full logs of AI interactions
– Free core; paid services fund spaces
– Community extensions & peer audits

> **Tiny, purposeful fear (responsible):** In closed systems, **prompt injection/hijacking** can silently steer tutoring outcomes without your knowledge. With SUNSCHOOL, parents can **see and lock** the prompt, require **coach review**, and **diff-track** any changes. (We educate, not scare: “Know the risk, own the prompt.”)

---

## Core narratives (campaign angles)

1. **“You Own the Prompt.”**
   Proofs: parent-side prompt editor, kid-safe profiles, audit trail, explain-my-answer. (Demo in <10 minutes; no IT.)

2. **“School Anywhere Under the Sun.”**
   Proofs: satellite/offline kits for AOT pop-ups; move seamlessly from tablet at the ranch to desktop in the city cowork hub. 

3. **“Open Source = Honest Tutoring.”**
   Proofs: public template library; community review; local extensions; founder partners publish their “prompt packs.”

---

## Brand voice & visuals

* Warm, intergenerational, nature-tech harmony. (Scandi-Zen, hand-rendered, no hyperreal faces.) Use mycelium/hexagon metaphors; sunlit barns; gentle blues/greens/golds. 
* Tie to AOT’s **“new town square”** promise: co-work, co-learn, co-exist—city & country loop.  

---

## Product offers (bundles)

* **Parent Starter (Free)**: 1 child profile, core tutor, parent prompt vault, weekly progress email.
* **Family Plus ($15–$25/mo)**: up to 4 child profiles, badges, richer reports, offline packs, parent community.
* **AOT Member Perk**: Family Plus included with **AOT Membership** at participating locations. Coached sessions available on-site. 
* **Founder/Host Kit** (B2B): site license, kiosk mode, satellite kit, training for Learning Coaches, event curriculum (Kids AI Storybooks, Milestone Monday workflows).  

---

## Signature campaigns (ready to run)

1. **“10 Minutes to Tutor” Tour**
   Pop a satellite kit; a parent builds a safe Algebra prompt; child completes a mini-lesson; parent sees real-time progress on a big screen. CTA: Start free → book your AOT session. (Works at Venice/Ventura, Phoenix/Flagstaff tour dates.) 

2. **“Prompt vs. Platform” Challenge**
   We put a popular closed tutor and SUNSCHOOL side-by-side. Parents inspect logs, try prompt edits, and export data. We do not name-and-shame; we highlight transparency advantages.

3. **“Family Sovereignty Week”**
   Seven days of themes: Data Dignity, Neurodiversity, Outdoors Day, Solstice Learning Rituals, Multi-Gen Mentors (grandma co-teacher sessions). Tie to **Summer/Winter Solstice** events.

## Website & landing architecture (AOT + SUNSCHOOL)

* **Hero**: “AI learning where **Parents Own the Prompt**. Built into every AOT space.” Sub: “Open-source, transparent, community-driven.”
* **Explainer**: 3 cards—Own the Prompt • See the Learning • School Anywhere.
* **For Parents / For Learners** sections (features you drafted—polish + add screenshots).
* **Open vs Closed** comparison block (above).
* **AOT Integration**: show co-work next to staffed learning spaces; weekly events grid.  
* **Tour Dates & City Waitlist** (feeds AOT pipeline). 
* **Security & Safety** (below).

---

## Trust, safety & “tiny fear” copy (transparent, not alarmist)

* **Threats parents should know:** prompt injection, hijacking via embedded content, context-poisoning, data lock-in.
* **Your controls:** parent-locked prompts, **“explain my answer”** toggle, **content provenance** flags, coach approval workflow, **diffs for any prompt change**, **export-everything**.
* **AOT environment:** staffed learning spaces with trained **Learning Coaches**; spectrum-friendly spaces; intergenerational norms. 

---

## In-space programming that sells itself

* **Kids AI Storybooks workshop** (recurring; capture videos for socials). 
* **Milestone Monday: AI Study Blocks** (two blocks/day) with on-site coaches while parents cowork. 
* **Progress Potluck + Sunset Sunday**: badges, dashboards, music, sunset. 

---

## Pricing & revenue logic (fits AOT)

* Keep **SUNSCHOOL core free** (ethos + top-of-funnel). Upsell AOT memberships, coached hours, events, and **real estate-anchored experiences**. (Make “school” side not the profit center—let the *place* and *programming* carry margin.) 

---

## Metrics that matter

* **Activation**: % who complete the **10-minute setup**; first prompt saved.
* **Engagement**: weekly learning minutes; parent prompt edits; coach approvals.
* **Learning**: mastery deltas per subject; project completions; reading minutes.
* **Community**: event attendance → AOT membership conversion.
* **Trust**: % sessions with “explain-my-answer” on; zero-incident rate.

---

## 90-day launch plan (tempo)

* **Days 1–30**: Ship demoable parent prompt vault; publish Prompt Gallery v1; film 3 founder stories; schedule **“10 Minutes to Tutor”** pop-ups in first two cities.
* **Days 31–60**: Run side-by-side **Prompt vs Platform** challenge nights; release security explainer + monthly open-prompt audit.
* **Days 61–90**: Bundle SUNSCHOOL Family Plus with AOT Founding Member offer; host **Progress Potluck** + **Sunset Sunday** showcase.

---

## FAQ seeds (for site)

* “How do I migrate prompts from a closed tutor?” → import tool + mapping guide.
* “Can I run SUNSCHOOL without internet?” → yes: satellite kit/offline content; sync later.
* “What if I’m not technical?” → coach-approved templates; 10-min quick start; live help at AOT.
* “Does open source mean ‘less safe’?” → No: more eyes, reproducible builds, parent locks, audit trails.

---

## How SUNSCHOOL nests inside AOT (positioning clarity)

* AOT = **“new town square”** where co-work, co-learn, co-exist interlock—**365 programming** in city hubs and **country lodges** with gardens, tiny homes, and star-gazing. SUNSCHOOL is the **learning engine** inside that ecosystem.  
* We sell a **lifestyle** (membership, events, place) powered by **transparent learning tech** (SUNSCHOOL). Families aren’t forced into “school as product”; they opt into **community as platform**.
