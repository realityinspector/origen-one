# Phase 3: Navigation Overhaul - Test Plan

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Mode Toggle Reliability Fixes (`/client/src/context/ModeContext.tsx`)
- **Fixed Race Condition**: Replaced `setTimeout` with `requestAnimationFrame` for better synchronization
- **State Update Pattern**: Changed to use React state updater callbacks (`setMode(prevMode => ...)`)
- **Navigation Timing**: Ensured navigation happens after state updates are committed
- **Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging for debugging mode switches

### 2. Visual Mode Indicators (`/client/src/components/OrigenHeader.tsx`)
- **Mode Badge**: Added prominent visual badge showing current mode
  - Green badge with üë¶ icon for LEARNER MODE
  - Blue badge with üë® icon for PARENT MODE
- **Always Visible**: Badge shows in header next to SUNSCHOOL‚Ñ¢ logo
- **Clear Differentiation**: Color-coded backgrounds make mode immediately obvious

### 3. Simplified Learner Selection Flow
- **Auto-Selection**: When toggling to LEARNER mode, first learner is auto-selected if none chosen
- **Clear Navigation Path**: No learners available ‚Üí redirects to /learners management page
- **Persistent Selection**: Selected learner ID saved to localStorage

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All tests pass** with no critical issues
‚úÖ **Mode toggle is reliable** - no flickering, race conditions, or stuck states
‚úÖ **Visual indicators are clear** - users always know which mode they're in
‚úÖ **Navigation is predictable** - routes behave as expected
‚úÖ **Persistence works** - mode and learner selection survive reloads
‚úÖ **No regressions** - Phases 1 & 2 features still work

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Learner selection flow** could be further simplified (remove redundant `/select-learner` page)
2. **Theme colors** are functional but could be enhanced with more visual differentiation
3. **Animation** during mode switch could be smoother

These are deferred improvements for future iterations.
