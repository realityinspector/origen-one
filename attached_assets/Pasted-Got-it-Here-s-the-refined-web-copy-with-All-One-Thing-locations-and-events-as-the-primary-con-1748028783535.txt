Got it! Here's the **refined web copy** with **All One Thing locations and events as the primary context**—homeschool, resilience, and mobility are still present, but *secondary*. This version positions **SUNSCHOOL powered by Origen™** as an **always-on educational layer inside AOT spaces**—as vital to the vibe as the espresso bar, yoga mat, or community meal.

## 🌞 SUNSCHOOL by AOT LABS

### **AI-powered learning. Built into every AOT space.**

**School...anywhere under the sun.**

SUNSCHOOL is our new open-source initiative that brings always-on, adaptive learning to every All One Thing location and event. Powered by **Origen™**, it transforms our co-working tables, backyard gazebos, and rooftop hammocks into mini learning hubs—for kids, teens, and curious adults alike.

Whether it's **after-school in Venice**, **weekend coding in Flagstaff**, or a **tiny house retreat in Ventura**, SUNSCHOOL makes AOT a place where learning is as natural as stargazing or sourdough baking.
