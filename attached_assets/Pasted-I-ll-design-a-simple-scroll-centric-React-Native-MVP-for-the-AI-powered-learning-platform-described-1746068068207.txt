### Backend API Endpoints

1. **Authentication**
   - `POST /api/auth/login`
   - `POST /api/auth/refresh-token`

2. **User Management**
   - `POST /api/users/create` (Admin creates parent)
   - `POST /api/users/learners` (Parent creates child)
   - `GET /api/users/learners` (Get all learners for parent)

3. **Lessons**
   - `GET /api/lessons/active` (Get active lesson for learner)
   - `POST /api/lessons/queue` (Create new lesson)
   - `POST /api/lessons/{lesson_id}/answer` (Submit quiz answer)
   - `GET /api/lessons` (Get lesson history)

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - `GET /api/users/graph` (Get knowledge graph)
   - `GET /api/achievements` (Get achievements)

### Database Schema

1. **Users Table**
   ```
   - id (UUID)
   - email (String)
   - name (String)
   - role (Enum: ADMIN, PARENT, LEARNER)
   - password_hash (String)
   - created_at (Timestamp)
   ```

2. **Learner Profiles Table**
   ```
   - id (UUID)
   - user_id (Foreign Key -> Users.id)
   - grade_level (Integer)
   - graph (JSON) - Knowledge graph representation
   - created_at (Timestamp)
   ```

3. **Lessons Table**
   ```
   - id (UUID)
   - learner_id (Foreign Key -> Learner_Profiles.id)
   - module_id (String)
   - status (Enum: QUEUED, ACTIVE, DONE)

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Setup and Authentication (2 weeks)
- Project initialization with React Native and Vite
- Database setup with PostgreSQL
- Authentication system implementation
- Basic user management

### Phase 2: Core Learning Features (3 weeks)
- Lesson generation system
- Quiz component
- Progress tracking
- Basic knowledge graph

### Phase 3: UI/UX and Refinement (2 weeks)
- Polishing user interfaces
- Implementing scroll-centric navigation
- Adding simple animations
- Testing and bug fixes

## MVP Simplifications

To keep the MVP simple, the following features will be simplified or deferred:

1. **AI Implementation**
   - Use predefined lesson templates instead of full AI generation
   - Implement basic adaptive quiz selection

2. **Knowledge Graph**
   - Simplified visual representation
   - Limited node connections

3. **Achievement System**
   - Basic badges for completion (no complex criteria)

4. **User Management**
   - Limited ability to customize learner profiles
   - Basic progress reports

## Design Principles

1. **Scroll-Centric Navigation**
   - Vertical scrolling as primary interaction method
   - Minimize tabs and complex navigation
   - Swipe gestures for moving between related screens

2. **Simplicity**
   - Clean, uncluttered interfaces
   - Focus on one primary action per screen
   - Clear visual hierarchy

3. **Engagement**
   - Vibrant colors and appealing illustrations
   - Immediate feedback on actions
   - Progress visualization always visible

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

1. **Offline Support**
   - Cache active lessons for offline use
   - Queue quiz answers for submission when online

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize image loading for various devices
   - Implement pagination for history views

3. **Accessibility**
   - Support screen readers

   - Support dynamic text sizing

## Future Expansion

After the MVP proves successful, these features can be considered:

1. **Enhanced AI Tutoring**
   - Real-time lesson generation
   - Adaptive learning paths
   - Multi-agent system architecture

2. **Community Features**
   - Hub scheduling and coordination
   - Parent messaging
   - Resource sharing

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Detailed learning insights
   - Predictive recommendations
   - Learning style identification

This MVP design focuses on creating a simple but effective learning platform that captures the essence of the community-centric education approach while keeping implementation straightforward and achievable.
