    getQuizSystemPrompt: (topic, gradeLevel) => `
  Create grade ${gradeLevel} questions about "${topic}" for ages 8-10.

  STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum 10 words per question (count every word!)
  - Multiple choice with 4 options
  - Test understanding, NOT memorization of facts
  - Use simple, clear wording
  - Avoid multi-part questions

  === EXAMPLES OF PERFECT QUESTIONS FOR GRADES 3-4 ===

  GOOD: "What makes plants grow?"
  Options: ["Sunlight and water", "Only rocks", "Just air", "Only dirt"]
  ✓ Simple vocabulary (4 words)
  ✓ Tests understanding of basic concept
  ✓ Clear options at grade level

  GOOD: "Which animal lays eggs?"
  Options: ["Chicken", "Dog", "Cat", "Horse"]
  ✓ Direct question (4 words)
  ✓ Tests classification knowledge
  ✓ All options are animals they know

  GOOD: "How do seeds travel?"
  Options: ["Wind or animals carry them", "They walk", "They fly alone", "They don't move"]
  ✓ Age-appropriate (4 words)
  ✓ Tests cause-and-effect understanding
  ✓ Options make sense to test knowledge

  === EXAMPLES OF BAD QUESTIONS (NEVER DO THIS) ===

  BAD: "What is the primary mechanism by which organisms adapt to environmental pressures?"
  ✗ Too many words (13 words!)
  ✗ Words "mechanism", "organisms", "environmental" too advanced
  ✗ Concept too abstract for 8-10 year olds

  BAD: "Considering the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration, which process occurs first?"
  ✗ Way too complex (14 words!)
  ✗ Multi-part concept
  ✗ Requires understanding beyond grade 3-4

  BAD: "What happens to water during the evaporation stage of the hydrological cycle?"
  ✗ Too technical: "evaporation", "hydrological"
  ✗ Better to ask: "What happens when water gets hot?"
